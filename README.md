# hik-pause
Pauses (disables) detection alarms on Hikvision cameras

## The need

Since I [aiGuard](https://github.com/len-ro/aiGuard) notifies me via pushover when it detects a person in images on cameras it is way easier to check camera footage. However if I am in the frame I receive a lot of notifications so what I wish is to be able to disable/enable the cameras detections via my smartphone.

This means I wish to disable motion/intrusion/line crossing/pir detections when I know I am around cameras and re-enable the initial config when I am away or sleeping, etc.

## Implementation
